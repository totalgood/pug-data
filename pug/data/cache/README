# pug/ann/data/cache/README

This folder contains locally cached data files (json and csv).

They are used as persistent memory for the "memoization" of data retrieval functions in the pug.ann.data package.

A few (like daily-KSFO-2010-2014.csv) are committed to the repository (along with the source code) to facilitate testing and user exercising of pug.ann.example even when network access is inconsistent.

No EULA's were harmed in the production of this data. ;)  See the LICENSE file in this same folder for more details.
